## Here is a little information about myself \\â˜º/

My name is Ching Xian. <span style="color: Green;">I am a Year 3 Architecture student with a passion for design and creativity.</span> While my main focus has been on architectural concepts and aesthetics, I am also eager to expand my skill set to include coding and web development.

My goal is to learn coding skills that will enable me to design and develop my own webpage. I am excited about the prospect of combining architectural design principles with interactive and user-friendly web interfaces.

I am looking forward to the learning journey and gaining insights from fellow enthusiasts and experts. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together! :)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Curious how I created this?

Here's how I did it:

```{r, out.height= "500px", out.width= "1800px", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Image 2: Using R Markdown and writing those code"}
knitr::include_graphics("Screenshot14-08-23.png")
```
```{r, out.height= "500px", out.width= "1800px", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Image 3: Using R Markdown and writing those code"}
knitr::include_graphics("Screenshot(2)14-08-23.png")
```
and using similar code, I input this image:P

So coding can be more fun than it looks!! Excited and definitely looking forward to make my webpage even more fabulous!

## Notes about NM2207

```{r, out.height= "350px",out.width= "800px",echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,fig.cap="Replace text here with the caption"}
{r, out.height= "350px",out.width= "800px",echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,fig.cap="Replace text here with the caption"}
knitr::include_graphics("insert_path_to_your_file_here") 
```

In the snippet above,

--> {r} is required to indicate to that whatever is enclosed within the three back-ticks are commands.

--> out.height and out.width are used to adjust the size of the figure, try changing the numbers and see what happens.

--> echo=*TRUE* makes sure that the commands are printed in the output document. If echo=*FALSE*, "Replace text here with the caption" will not be appearing.  

--> an alternative way to insert image: image into the default Working Folder, and "--.png/jpg"

--> eval=TRUE makes sure that commands are executed and that the results are printed, meaning the image will appear. If eval=*FALSE*, meaning earlier evaluation is *FALSE* and image will not appear.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
